title: 'AdaCL: Adaptive Continual Learning'
abstract: 'Class-Incremental Learning aims to update a deep classifier to learn new
  categories while maintaining or improving its accuracy on previously observed classes.
  Common methods to prevent forgetting previously learned classes include regularizing
  the neural network updates and storing exemplars in memory, which come with hyperparameters
  such as the learning rate, regularization strength, or the number of exemplars.
  However, these hyperparameters are usually only tuned at the start and then kept
  fixed throughout the learning sessions, ignoring the fact that newly encountered
  tasks may have varying levels of novelty or difficulty. This study investigates
  the necessity of hyperparameter ’adaptivity’ in Class-Incremental Learning: the
  ability to dynamically adjust hyperparameters such as the learning rate, regularization
  strength, and memory size according to the properties of the new task at hand. We
  propose AdaCL, a Bayesian Optimization-based approach to automatically and efficiently
  determine the optimal values for those parameters with each learning task. We show
  that adapting hyperpararmeters on each new task leads to improvement in accuracy,
  forgetting and memory. Code is available at https://github.com/ElifCerenGokYildirim/AdaCL.'
