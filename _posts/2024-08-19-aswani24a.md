title: Examining Changes in Internal Representations of Continual Learning Models
  Through Tensor Decomposition
abstract: Continual learning (CL) has spurred the development of several methods aimed
  at consolidating previous knowledge across sequential learning. Yet, the evaluations
  of these methods have primarily focused on the final output, such as changes in
  the accuracy of predicted classes, overlooking the issue of representational forgetting
  within the model. In this paper, we propose a novel representation-based evaluation
  framework for CL models. This approach involves gathering internal representations
  from throughout the continual learning process and formulating three-dimensional
  tensors. The tensors are formed by stacking representations, such as layer activations,
  generated from several inputs and model ‘snapshots’, throughout the learning process.
  By conducting tensor component analysis (TCA), we aim to uncover meaningful patterns
  about how the internal representations evolve, expecting to highlight the merits
  or shortcomings of examined CL strategies. We conduct our analyses across different
  model architectures and importance-based continual learning strategies, with a curated
  task selection. Often, the results of our approach mirror the difference in performance
  of various CL strategies on various architectures. Ultimately, however, we found
  that our methodology did not directly highlight specialized clusters of neurons,
  nor provide an immediate understanding the evolution of filters. We believe a scaled
  down variation of our approach will provide insight into the benefits and pitfalls
  of using TCA to study continual learning dynamics.
