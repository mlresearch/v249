title: 'Two Complementary Perspectives to Continual Learning: Ask Not Only What to
  Optimize, But Also How'
abstract: Recent years have seen considerable progress in the continual training of
  deep neural networks, predominantly thanks to approaches that add replay or regularization
  terms to the loss function to approximate the joint loss over all tasks so far.
  However, we show that even with a perfect approximation to the joint loss, these
  approaches still suffer from temporary but substantial forgetting when starting
  to train on a new task. Motivated by this ‘stability gap’, we propose that continual
  learning strategies should focus not only on the optimization objective, but also
  on the way this objective is optimized. While there is some continual learning work
  that alters the optimization trajectory (e.g., using gradient projection techniques),
  this line of research is positioned as alternative to improving the optimization
  objective, while we argue it should be complementary. In search of empirical support
  for our proposition, we perform a series of pre-registered experiments combining
  replay-approximated joint objectives with gradient projection-based optimization
  routines. However, this first experimental attempt fails to show clear and consistent
  benefits. Nevertheless, our conceptual arguments, as well as some of our empirical
  results, demonstrate the distinctive importance of the optimization trajectory in
  continual learning, thereby opening up a new direction for continual learning research.
