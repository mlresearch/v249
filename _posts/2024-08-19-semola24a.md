title: Adaptive Hyperparameter Optimization for Continual Learning Scenarios
abstract: Hyperparameter selection in continual learning scenarios is a challenging
  and underexplored aspect, especially in practical non-stationary environments. Traditional
  approaches, such as grid searches with held-out validation data from all tasks,
  are unrealistic for building accurate lifelong learning systems. This paper aims
  to explore the role of hyperparameter selection in continual learning and the necessity
  of continually and automatically tuning them according to the complexity of the
  task at hand. Hence, we propose leveraging the nature of sequence task learning
  to improve Hyperparameter Optimization efficiency. By using the functional analysis
  of variance-based techniques, we identify the most crucial hyperparameters that
  have an impact on performance. We demonstrate empirically that this approach, agnostic
  to continual scenarios and strategies, allows us to speed up hyperparameters optimization
  continually across tasks and exhibit robustness even in the face of varying sequential
  task orders. We believe that our findings can contribute to the advancement of continual
  learning methodologies towards more efficient, robust and adaptable models for real-world
  applications.
